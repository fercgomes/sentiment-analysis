# Classificação e Pesquisa de Dados - INF/UFRGS

This program's goal is to be a implementation of the following strucutures and algorithms:
- Hash tables
- Inverted files
- Preffix search, using Trie trees
- Sentiment analysis of movie reviews, as seen in [Kaggle's Sentiment Analysis challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/)

## Dependencies
The only dependency is *ncurses*, so it only runs on Linux.

## How to use
Usage is pretty straight-forward:
```sh
$ make
$ cd bin && ./main
```

Please note that within the options that require filenames, you should use relative paths to where the executable is or absolute paths.
